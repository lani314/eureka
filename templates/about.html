    <h1>Why Eureka?</h1>
  
  <p>Eureka was inspired by a basic concept: we try too hard to imagine.</p>

  <p>But, when do we NOT try? What happens then? It turns out some of our best discoveries come unexpectedly, through random events and unexpected associations</p>

  <p>Think about it: The story of Archimedes and his bathtub discovery. The cut-up method of William Burroughs. We are inspired by the random, surreal and unexpected</p>

  <p>With this in mind, Eureka was created to let you begin projects -- and then have a magical dash of randomness help you figure out the rest.</p>

  <p>But how random is TOO random? Sometimes, random things don't help us make interesting connections. So, Eureka allows for a mixed "synonym" option to complement the randomness. Once you're creating ideas, just click on the "mix" button to see!</p>

  <p>Happy creating!</p>
